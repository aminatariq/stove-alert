You were going to be back in 5 minutes? Have you burnt food? Have your stove accident caused damages?\nStats: 7.2 billion is spent annually on home fire damages. Unattended cooking is the leading factor for cooking fires. Generally each fire damage cause $3,000 to $5,000, not including the time, the stress, and potential injuries.\nThis is where Stove Alert would save the day! We will monitor from a magnet attachment to your fan. When it reaches an optimal heat temperature, it will send you customized alerts to your phone and a voice/buzzer alert. It will have snooze timer button if you want additional time. In the event of an unresponsive alert, it will automatically escalate to your next of contact. In addition, it will have a shutdown switch for your stove!</p><p>Example.</p><p>I am boiling water. I fell asleep, I did not wake up to the messages. In 5 minutes it will text my roommate. No response, it will text my neighbour. No response, it will text the condo concierge. No response, it will next my landlord. It will continue going down the list until there is a respond reply.\nNow imagine, it will alert a nursing home when its elderly users do not respond to the buzzer. All these alerts are customizable for each contact and time limit.\nMore important feature we will have shutdown option on electric stove tops.\nThis is an easy set up option. Stick Stove Alert via a magnet to your fan (we will include a sticky option if otherwise). Set up your alerting patterns. And you, and your family or love ones will be protected.\n<a href=\'https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/K68DKPT\' target=\'_blank\'>Take our survey</a>, we would love to hear from you!\n</p></div><div class="bottom"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-4 feature"><img src="/assets/img/icon-gears.png" class="icon"/><h4>Simple</h4><p>Easy and quick installation</p></div><div class="col-md-4 feature"><img src="/assets/img/icon-sensor.png" class="icon"/><h4>Lightweight</h4><p>Constantly monitors your stovetop</p></div><div class="col-md-4 feature"><img src="/assets/img/icon-mobile.png" class="icon"/><h4>Efficent</h4><p>Sends an alert if overheating is detected</p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><span>&copy; 2014	StoveAlert</span></div></div></div>')}]);
